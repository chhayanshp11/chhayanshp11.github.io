If you are reading this, believe me, “**Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning and Dreams do come True!!**” And with that note, let me walk you through my career path and how my interest in technology lead me to where I am today :)

I have a strong passion for using technology to solve the world's biggest problems one byte at a time. As a technologist, I have expertise in Data Science and Analytics, Cyber Security, Software Engineering, finding trends in the data and Program Management. 

All these skills are aquired over the years. Interestingly, I got introduced to programming and data science in my freshman year at [Jabalpur Engineering College, Jabalpur](https://www.jecjabalpur.ac.in/) where I completed my Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (2017-2021).

I joined [Infosys Ltd](https://www.infosys.com/) as a Data Engineer contracted to [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/). Developed  Pfizer Registry Quality Control Management System, a Rules Engine for changed data capture and logic rule check using SQL database and Alteryx workflows.

Decided to get into Techno-Management and flew to the States (USA) to get my Master's of Science in Information Technology and Management from [The University of Texas at Dallas.](https://www.utdallas.edu/)

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
