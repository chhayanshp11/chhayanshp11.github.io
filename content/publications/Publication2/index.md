- Examined 26/11 Mumbai Attack terrorist network dataset and designed a framework with a fitness function employing Primâ€™s Algorithm for enrichment of key node evaluation on the terrorist network.

- Based on the designed framework, it is resolved that the obtained crucial nodes can be instrumental for the intelligence agencies to confine their focus on crucial members deterring the functioning of these networks.
